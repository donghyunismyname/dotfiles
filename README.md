# dotfiles
An attempt to create my own dotfiles.
`zsh`, `vim`, and `tmux` combine together to create an awesome
development environment.


## Recommended Fonts
- (DroidSansMono Nerd Font) https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/DroidSansMNerdFontMono-Regular.otf
- (D2Coding) https://github.com/naver/d2codingfont


## Dependency (install on your own)
Mostly like you can use `apt` or `brew` to install them.
- zsh
- tree (show directory stuructures as a tree)
- bat (like cat but fancy)
- tmux
- ripgrep
- fd (try `fd` or `fd-find` for installation)
- neovim
- emacs


## Dependency (install script provided)
- oh-my-zsh
- fzf
- cdhist
- diff-so-fancy (make git diff fancy)


## Installation
Run the installation script inside project diretory
```
dotfiles$ sh install-dependency.sh
dotfiles$ sh install-symlink.sh
dotfiles$ sh configure-git.sh
```
It's likely that things do not work.
In that case, please install manually following the scripts.


## Install Latest Neovim
```
sudo apt-get remove neovim -y

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install neovim -y
```



## Troubleshooting
